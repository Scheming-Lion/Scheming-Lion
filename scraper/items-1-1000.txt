It really is amazing. For example, there are no timers on the calls. Ever wonder why some CSR's are so brusk? Well, they're usually trying to beat the clock. If their average call time goes above some magic number (often as low as two or three minutes) then they get written up by their supervisor. No such problem at Lands' End.\r\n\r\nI had to smile that Joel linked to the OCS (The Online Customer Store where he orders his logo'd shirts). I was one of the lead developers on that project. :-)\r\n\r\nAs for what happens to the returned items? They're sold off in the company employee store for a few dollars. If the company makes stipulations about the use of their logo, then a patch is applied over it, before selling to the employees, to protect the customers brand.

He converted HotOrNot from an S-corporation to a C-corporation.  You can certainly reinvest profits from an S-corporation into the business or pay out profits from a C-corporation as dividends, but the incentives go different ways.  S-corp earnings are taxed as ordinary income (none of the double-taxation of corporate profits) and S-corps can't give out different classes of shares, so there's an incentive to distribute the profits out to the shareholders.  C-corp earnings are taxed once at the corporate level and then once as dividend earnings, yet they can have multiple classes of shareholders.

We've had to enact a policy at our company- if you ask someone how their stay has been and they say &#34;well, it rained a few of the days,&#34; whatever you do, _don't_ say &#34;yah, sorry about that- too bad,&#34; even though that's the most natural thing in the world to say.

A single hacker isn't going to make a Meetup group to find other hackers; that takes too much work. It should be more like Craigslist, but for this startup community. Sorted by city, people can exchange email addresses, screen names, and most importantly, ideas. <p>All it takes is two founders, and you never know what kind of matches people will find. <p>Granted, they should know that they can work together before taking on a  huge project, but I think that something of this sort will really help people discover one another and get their startups going.<p>I'm not suggesting we re-invent Craigslist, but there are enough people here to merit something like this.

Sorry about that.<p>If anyone cares, it was because the http server is also written in Arc, on top of MzScheme, and we misread the MzScheme doc on make-limited-input-port to believe that limit-k referred to k of bytes.  In fact it refers to bytes.  So while we thought we were capping http requests at 2 meg, we were in fact capping them at 2k. ","time":"1172206733","type":"comment"}

That is, if you yourself can't stop using it regardless of who else is using it, it is a stronger product.  del.icio.us is like that- I started using it because it was a nice central place to store bookmarks regardless of who else was using it.  It was only later that I started noticing how many others were bookmarking and even started using it as a search engine.  Flickr- same thing.  Youtube & myspace- still kind of the same- say I was the first user of youtube, I may still like it so that I can put my videos in one place and shoot off an email to my buddies to go have a look.  The point is the tool better be compelling without a community or you'll never be able to grow a community.

This is a major paradigm shift from less than a decade ago when we bought books solely based on recommendations from humans rather than computers.

Not having expectations of growing a startup to Facebook, Google or Bebo size you are going to be wasting a VC's time. This is no mean feat - you have to be mentally prepared to grow and scale a company like mad and similarly your startup must have proved its case for being able to scale.<p>Whats the best way to know if your startup is ready? build a prototype, get some traction, look at the numbers, measure, experiment then measure again. If you truly are going to scale (and you are growing at 1% a day) and you've experimented enough that you've found a suitable path you'll end up needing money of the VC scale.<p>It doesn't cost much to sit around and build something. Go and test it - figure out what people want first - change your assumptions and above all PROVE that if you scaled your site it'd be worth it for investors. You don't need VC yet to start something and test it out - If it comes to that point well thats something to think about.<p>I'm reminded of the story Michael Birch of Bebo tells - they built something, put it out there off the traffic of birthday alarm and experimented with features. Every time a feature added to the growth of the site and got a noticeable increase in users they kept it and tried something else which also contributed to the growth. By experimenting, measuring and then iterating for things which correlated for growth they ended up on the right path. When they had 5 million users and were growing month on month they had the numbers to prove themselves. They took $15m from Benchmark capital. The bottom line - you'll know when you are ready: just go prove the numbers. ","time":"1172368210","type":"comment"}

{"by":"reitzensteinm","id":"967","parent":"957","text":"Yeah, it's probably not so applicable to consumer facing internet companies since the approach really needs a business to buy into the idea (much more willing to preorder, a single sale could fund the entire development). <p>Although maybe that depends on what you are creating. I could see something like Hotmail or Skype being bootstrapped with this method, because those services are useful to both individuals and businesses. Back then, email from any PC with the internet or free international voice calls would have been things that many businesses would have paid for (and still would, if there weren't so many free alternatives now). Even Reddit got its NYT deal soon after starting which pushed it into the black, did it not? (not rhetorical - I don't know much about their history so tell me if I'm wrong!)<p>There is the problem of loss of focus though. If a company like Hotmail started in '95, realised it could make millions selling their product to companies and focused on that (sales, turnkey servers for easy installation), they would probably only get a few years of that income at most before they are dethroned by a company that just focused on making the best web based email possible. So it would be a bit of a local maxmimum. Is this more dangerous than the loss of focus of doing something totally unhelpful/unrelated to the main product to bring in some cash (contracting, searching for investors) while simultaneously working on the final product?

{"by":"hayeah","id":"978","parent":"374","text":"I would second this. <p>In my mind, however, what would be more useful for us budding founders is a place where we can share our ideas and projects in their early embarrassing states. It would be nice the be able to get feedback right at the beginning when I have only the the vaguest idea, and then to be guided by feedback as the project develops and matures. I would not be comfortable to share my pre-pre alpha project on reddit. And people would not be interested.<p>I believe that the search-space is too great that we should ever worry about other people stealing our precious idea. Starting from one point, different people would diverge and develop in different ways.<p>I don't know. But I would really welcome more openness. I think when an idea is interesting, and new, people would rather cooperate, and help along. Competition only happens (I hope) when people are chasing after the roughly same fad.\n","time":"1172385324","type":"comment"}

The authors of the book &#34;PayBack&#34; insist that any innovation is pointless unless it leads to profit. I know a lot of people on this site are startup (co)founders; so I would like to encourage everyone to take a little time to atleast ramp up a business plan other than one that involves Google's adsense :)","time":"1172392886","type":"comment"}

{"by":"python_kiss","id":"994","parent":"992","text":"In-game advertising is a severely underdeveloped business considering how long games have been around. Since this concept is new, branding within video games would work much better than it does on old-media (print/television). This has a huge potential especially in multiplayer games that require thoughtful analysis and interaction with the virtual medium (as opposed to passively watching the television). Both the market and the technology already exists; it is simply a matter of time before some startup (like adscape) takes a large piece of it.","time":"1172393463","type":"comment"}
