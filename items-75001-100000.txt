When you're visualizing a data structure, it probably looks like boxes connected to each other with arcs. And I think your book has nice pictures for ADTs, too (stacks, queues, etc. drawn using boxes and maybe arcs as well). Whereas it's clear that an algorithm is very different from a data structure because it's described using pseudo-code.

Stop holding back so much. :)<p>I know it's fun to lob rhetorical hand grenades around. The nice thing about the US is that we have a system where failure is accepted. If you don't like the policies or leaders, there will always be someone along later that's more to your liking.  We've done all kinds of screwed up stuff -- and all kinds of good stuff. I think it's absolutely important to point out where we're wrong, but a little perspective can be useful too. <p>In my perfect world there would be a lot less government involvement in all of our lives. We would be armed and take care of things like terrorism ourselves right when it happened, instead of farming the responsibility for our security out to big government. But both the left and the right want to take away all of our freedoms and do all the worrying and thinking for us.  So that means we turn what should be personal things like health care, personal security, property ownership, and privacy into a huge multi-generational political argument without resolution. And then people complain that the government gets it wrong!   I think people are all too happy to take away somebody else's freedom for their pet cause. It's just when somebody else does it to them that they squeal the most. That's why I can only answer what freedoms I am personally willing to trade in the war on terror. I can't and won't make those decisions for other people.<p>I can make one observation, though. As democracies are attacked by terrorism they have a tendency to get more and more restrictive. I would expect the US to follow that pattern -- it has in the past. The thing I am watching is whether those restrictions are temporary or permanent.<p>I don't countenance too much the argument that politicians use fear to keep the war on terror machine humming along. To me that sounds a lot more paranoid than just simply acknowledging that there are people right now who are actively plotting to kill lots of Americans. It's nothing to go beserko about, just something to consider when you make decisions to vote for representatives. If attacks continue over the next few decades, voters will punish politicians who downplay the threat of terrorism. That's just political reality.","time":"1193941354","type":"comment"}

I'm sure someone at Y combinator can recommend a decent lawyer over there. You should not have to pay a great deal for this, but it is best to have it done professionally so that in the worse case scenario (that you guys fall out with each other), you're legally sorted from the outset. Its probably not a good idea to try and do this yourself. I do mean that sincerely and not in a patronising way at all, you want to be able to focus on your start-up and not be worrying about what would happen if things went wrong. Good luck.","time":"1193928693","type":"comment"}

And when you are ready, how long will it take before you generate enough profit (not sales) that can support two full-time employees?   Is this person an employee or a co-Founder?  Are you giving this person 50% because you cannot afford to pay salary and are you giving this person 50% because you need his intellectual contribution in addition to effort?  Or are you just looking for a companion?  And if this is a co-Founder, will you need still outside funding (VC or angel) once the person joins you?<p>In other words, lawyer cannot protect you if you don't know what you want.
